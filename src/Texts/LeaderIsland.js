One demand was that it should work both for as a responsive webapplication but also as app for both iOs and Android."
const result = "The end result is a gorgeous platform, developed both for web and apps, with custom icons. One challenge was to have in account that each community would be able to change logo and apply a branding color. The solution had to be able to have any background color and any logo. I worked closely with the development team to make this a reality by working with a lot of transparency and make almost 50 custom icons that had to work both with dark colors and light colors. "

const descImage3 = "The whole design is based on different amount of opacities to make it easy for the user to change theme by chosing only one color. The gradient is achieved by analysing the HSV values from the base colors, while the transparency is achieved by simply have different amounts of white on the backgrounds."
