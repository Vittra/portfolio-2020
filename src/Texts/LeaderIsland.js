const roleDescription = "The purpose of my engagement with LeaderIsland was to redesign their product. To take it from a purely functional product to a more gorgeous and user-friendly solution. One demand was that it should work both for as a responsive web application but also as app for both iOs and Android."
const result = "The end result is a gorgeous platform, developed both for web and apps, with custom icons. One challenge was to have in account that each community would be able to change the logo and apply a branding color. The solution had to be able to have any background color and any logo. I worked closely with the development team to make this a reality by working with a lot of transparency and make almost 50 custom icons that had to work both with dark colors and light colors."
const descImage1 = "From the left you can see the starting point, all the wireframing steps and furthest to the right are the final result. The importance of thorough work by letting the interface take form with wireframes is crucial for my process."

const descImage2 = "Since LeaderIsland is a service for any kind of business, and the app should feel custom to each client, without taking to much time, it was crucial to have an adaptive icon collection. All the icons needed to work as dark and light icons since the different clients would have different background colors."
const altImage2 = "Picture of all the icons in positive and negative colors"
const descImage3 = "The whole design is based on different amounts of opacities to make it easy for the user to change the theme by choosing only one color. The gradient is achieved by analyzing the HSV values from the base colors, while the transparency is achieved by simply have different amounts of white on the backgrounds."
