To satisfy stakeholders and users is the core of all new development. When I started with this project 2018 my first challenge was to redesign the application for users, this needed to work both on desktop and on smartphones. After that was achieved I moved on to sync the rest of their offerings with this newly designed applications, after that the role has increased in both the number of parts I’m involved with and also my role has grown from UI to include both UX, project lead, facilitator for workshops and presentations."
